This project aims to compare three different basic algorithms to forecast the mean temperature of the
day for the upcoming week. Each day's temperature depends on various factors such as the temperature of the
previous day (and the days before that), wind speed, humidity, etc. 

There are several algorithms that can be used to forecast time-series data such as moving averages,
exponential smoothing, ARMA, ARIMA, neural networks, growth curves, etc. In this project,
three approaches are used to forecast the mean temperature of a day - AR, ARIMA, and the
Multivariate VAR model.
